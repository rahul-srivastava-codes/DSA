// Linked list (important)
Why linked list
Creating an array also refers to waste of memory, hence
linked list is used so as it is pace efficient (although its vague statement to certain extent)
A thing called node exist in LL.
1) Problem with array -> size is fixed in case of dynamic memory alllocation and also space wastage, so we want variable size data structure
2) Difference between both

Example 
1-> 2-> 4-> 6->8
1 is head also called as reference varible 
8 is tail 

If we want to get the third element of the LL, then set head of LL to temp  and then iterate over 
the  LL to get the element present in which index.

Also keyword used to define ll in java is
LinkedList<Integer> name = new LinkedList<>();


What is double linked list?
Bro in linked list  you were going one way 
but through this new Linked list , you can come backward to, but
obvious you need one more node for back travelling

What is circular linked list?
