Lecture 131

since computer system works on binary number everything here is in numbers either word, number or signs
ASCII -> American Standard Code for Information Interchange
Ascii code for english language

for defining we use
char temp or char temp = 'A'; 
temp = 'A' should be in sinngle quote and in memory 65 is stored
printf("%c", temp) -> character
printf("%d", temp) -> character code

For array of character 
char X[5] 
char X[5] = { 'A', 'b', 'C', 'D', 'E')
char X[5] = { 68.69,70,71,72)
char X[5] = { 'A', 'b') and rest have garbage value and rest places kown as delimiter, null chaacter , \0
to make string we have to add at last '\0' once character ends
char X[] = { 'A', 'b', 'C', 'D', 'E')
char X[5] = "john"
printf("%s", name);

scanf for one word
getf  

for multiple words finding length is shown below:
int main(){
char S[]= "Welcome"
int i ;
for (i=0; s[i] != "\0', i++){
length++;
}

printf("%d", length or i)  
}
