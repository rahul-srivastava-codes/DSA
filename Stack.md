When you go to marriage/party and you have to eat, then we see 
piles of plates one over the other. 
we can take plate only on the top , not at bottom. So  these is 
example of stack
Stack follow FILO and LIFO rules
pop = removal from top
push = adding at the top 

Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
Stack is a class, queue is an interface
Example you to go movie and stand in the line of ticket counter
This is Queue which follows FIFO and LILO

Deque -> insertion and removal from both the ends
