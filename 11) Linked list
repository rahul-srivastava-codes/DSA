// Linked list (important)
Why linked list
Creating an array also refers to waste of memory, hence
linked list is used so as it is pace efficient (although its vague statement to certain extent)
A thing called node exist in LL.
1) Problem with array -> size is fixed in case of dynamic memory alllocation and also space wastage, so we want variable size data structure
2) Difference between both

Example 
1-> 2-> 4-> 6->8
1 is head also called as reference varible 
8 is tail 

ALso keyword used to define ll in java is
LinkedList<Integer> name = new LinkedList<>();


int a[5] -> inside stack
int *p = new int[5]; -> inside heap

What is node in DS?
A node is a fundamental unit of a data structure that contains data and can link to other nodes
We mostly create it in heap

Lecture 172

What is linked list?
Collection of node which contains data and pointer(stores address) to next node

How node is created?

struct Node{
  int data;
  struct Node *next;
}
struct Node *p ;
p =  (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node)) or p = new Node

p-> data

Lecture 173
How we connect 2 nodes
let second node be q
then 
1) q = p
2) q = p->next
3) p = p->next
