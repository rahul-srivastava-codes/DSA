// Linked list
Why linked list

1) Problem with array -> size is fixed in case of dynamic memory alllocation and also space wastage, so we want variable size data structure
2) Difference between both


int a[5] -> inside stack
int *p = new int[5]; -> inside heap

What is node in DS?
A node is a fundamental unit of a data structure that contains data and can link to other nodes
We mostly create it in heap

Lecture 172

What is linked list?
Collection of node which contains data and pointer(stores address) to next node

How node is created?

struct Node{
  int data;
  struct Node *next;
}
struct Node *p ;
p =  (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node)) or p = new Node

p-> data

Lecture 173
How we connect 2 nodes
let second node be q
then 
1) q = p
2) q = p->next
3) p = p->next
